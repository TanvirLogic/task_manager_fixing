 // First understanding the postRequest method.

 for a http.post() -> I need to pass an uri which will be
come from an URL, then I need to pass the header as well as the body.
Like this -> body: jsonEncode(body)

For each request I have to mind it that , A response will be given. Then I need to decode the response
and save to response data , which is a dynamic variable.
That means : in class -> final dynamic responseData;

But I have to understand that ->
                                    Future<ApiResponse> postRequest({
                                     required String url,
                                     Map<String, dynamic>? body,
                                   }) async { // Codes }

                                   That means this function will return ApiResponse


// getRequest method is almost similar.
