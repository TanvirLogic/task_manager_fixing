First checked the Splash Screen ->

// SplashScreen -> There I have build the Scaffold and the screen and called method
_moveToNextScreen, initially. This method checked if the app has previous login info.
Currently thinking I have no login info. So it will go to LoginScreen .

Step 01 : SplashScreen to LoginScreen [Checked if data is there for without login]


AS this is pretty small size app so that is why We need to save the routes with their name
in app.dart file. Before naming each screen has a constant like this :

 " static const String name = '/login'; "

 used routes like this :
 "      initialRoute: SplashScreen.name, // First SplashScreen Show
        routes: {
          SplashScreen.name: (_) => SplashScreen(),
          LoginScreen.name: (_) => LoginScreen(),
          SignUpScreen.name: (_) => SignUpScreen(),
          MainNavBarHolderScreen.name: (_) => MainNavBarHolderScreen(),
          UpdateProfileScreen.name: (_) => UpdateProfileScreen(),
          // Created Some Routes
        },
 "

 // LoginScreen -> Basic UI and Contained a button -> After Hitting the button

    _onTapLoginButton() ->  _login(); // Here Api Call done, as this this post request

    *** In api postRequest method , it will return ApiResponse type data
    For this We have to understand api_caller.dart file
